# Usage with Turbopack

To use [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack), simple
append the `--turbopack` flag to your development command:

```diff filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
-  "dev": "next dev"
+  "dev": "next dev --turbopack"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Without `--turbopack` flag Next.js under the hood uses
> [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), written in JavaScript.

## Only serializable options are supported

For this moment only JSON serializable values can be passed in `nextra`
function. This mean that with Turbopack enabled you can't pass custom
`remarkPlugins`, `rehypePlugins` or `recmaPlugins` since they are functions.

The following options could be passed only without Turbopack or only while
building your app with `next build`
([since Turbopack isn't support `next build` for now](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack#unsupported-features)
and Webpack is used instead).

```js filename="next.config.js" {5-7}
import nextra from 'nextra';

const withNextra = nextra({
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [myRemarkPlugin],
    rehypePlugins: [myRehypePlugin],
    recmaPlugins: [myRecmaPlugin],
  },
});
```

If you try to pass them, you'll get an error from Turbopack:

```text copy=false
Error: loader nextra/loader for match "./{src/app,app}/**/page.{md,mdx}" does not have serializable options.
Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.
```
