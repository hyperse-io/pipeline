# GitHub Alert Syntax

`nextra-theme-docs` and `nextra-theme-blog` support replacing
[GitHub alert syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts)
with `<Callout>` component for `.md`/`.mdx` files.

## Usage

```md filename="Markdown"
> [!NOTE]
>
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
>
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]

```

## Usage with your own theme

If you want to benefit this feature with your own theme and your own `<Callout>`
component:

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components';

<Steps>

### Create a `<Blockquote>` component

To create a `<Blockquote>` component, start by importing `withGitHubAlert` from
`nextra/components`. You should then create the `<Blockquote>` component by
invoking the `withGitHubAlert` function.

The first argument should be a React HOC component that handles the GitHub alert
syntax, and the second argument should be your standard `<blockquote>`
component.

The `type` prop can be one of the following:
`'note' | 'tip' | 'important' | 'warning' | 'caution'{:ts}`.

```jsx
import { withGitHubAlert } from 'nextra/components';

const Blockquote = withGitHubAlert(({ type, ...props }) => {
  return <MyCalloutComponent type={type} {...props} />;
}, MyBlockquoteComponent);
```

### Provide `<Blockquote>` to `useMDXComponents`

To make the `<Blockquote>` component available, you should integrate it into the
`useMDXComponents` function:

```jsx filename="mdx-components.jsx"
export function useMDXComponents(components) {
  return {
    blockquote: Blockquote,
    ...components,
  };
}
```

</Steps>
