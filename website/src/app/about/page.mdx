# About Nextra

Nextra was initially created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) members
[Shu Ding](https://twitter.com/shuding_) and
[Paco Coursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey) in 2020. Since 2021,
[Yixuan Xu](https://twitter.com/yixuanxu94) contributed tremendously to the
project.

In 2022, [Dimitri Postolov](https://twitter.com/dimaMachina_) from
[The Guild](https://the-guild.dev) joined the core team to help with the
development of Nextra 2.

In 2024 Nextra 3 was released, current primary maintainer Dimitri Postolov fully
developed it, and [Oscar Xie](https://github.com/87xie)
[actively contributed](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+author%3A87xie+is%3Aclosed+created%3A%3C2024-10-03)
to this release.

In 2025 Nextra 4 with [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) support was
released, Dimitri Postolov fully developed it too.
